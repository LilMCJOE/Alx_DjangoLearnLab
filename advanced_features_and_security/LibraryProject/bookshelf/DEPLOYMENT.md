# HTTPS Deployment Guide

## 1. SSL/TLS Certificate Setup

To enable HTTPS, you need an SSL/TLS certificate. You can obtain a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) or use Let's Encrypt.

## 2. Web Server Configuration

### Nginx Configuration
1. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:

2. Serve your Django application over HTTPS:


   <!-- ssl_certificate /path/to/your_certificate.crt;
   ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your_private_key.key;

   location / {
       proxy_pass http://your_django_application;
   } -->

## 3. Security Headers

Ensure your server configuration includes security headers such as `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy`.

## 4. Testing

After deploying, test your site using [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to ensure that HTTPS is correctly implemented and all security headers are in place.
